2048 CLI
========

A rendition of 2048 on the command line.

When I found out that 2048 was blocked on my District's WiFi, I knew what I had to do. 
From conception to a working model, there were several weeks, but the majority of the work was done on one weekend. After I reached an efficient combination algorithm, everything else was smooth-sailing (thanks, Eric). 

Concepts I learned on this project:
  - Queues (concept, initialization, function properties)
  - FiFo - FiLo data structures
  - Table-Top Values
